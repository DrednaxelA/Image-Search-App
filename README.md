- The application can be accessed here: https://drednaxela.github.io/Image-Search-App/

This is the first of many (hopefully) basic projects I'll create with the sole purpose of learning and improving my test automation/unit testing abilities while also improving in JS/HTML/CSS overall.
Currently, the application is obviously lacking some logical behaviors and UI features, but I'll be adding more as I learn.
Thanks for reading and trying out the App (if you did).
